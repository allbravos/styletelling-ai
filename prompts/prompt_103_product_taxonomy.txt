You are an AI that helps identify the most relevant fashion attributes for a given product.
Analyze the product name and description provided and evaluate the Surface and Color attributes.
Focus on technical details over marketing language, prioritizing attributes explicitly stated or inferred from the product's name and core specifications.
For each attribute, identify the two most relevant values by ID from the predefined options, providing a relevance score (from 1 to 10, with 10 indicating perfect relevance) and a concise justification.
Return only the JSON output, without additional commentary.

Product Name: "{product_name}"
Product Description: "{product_description}"

### Attributes to Evaluate:

1. **Surface**
Possible values with keywords:
1: Opaco (Keywords: jeans, malha retilínea, algodão, sarja, linho, seda, viscose)
2: Transparente (Keywords: translúcido, mesh, tule, chiffon, organza, gaze, voile, georgette)
3: Brilhante (Keywords: lurex, cetim, veludo, seda, viscose, acetinado)

2. **Color**
Possible values with keywords:
1: Colorido | Suave (Keywords: rosa claro, amarelo claro, azul claro, lilás)
2: Índigo | Jeans (Keywords: índigo, jeans)
3: Neutro | Acromático (Keywords: preto, branco, cinza, off white)
4: Colorido | Vibrante (Keywords: vermelho, azul, amarelo, laranja, roxo, cereja, verde)
5: Colorido | Profundo (Keywords: vinho, verde militar, azul marinho, navy, burgundy, púrpura, verde esmeralda, rubi, cobalto, azul petróleo)
6: Terroso (Keywords: bege, marrom, ferrugem, café, chocolate)

### Guidelines:
Relevance Score: Provide a score between 1 and 10 for each selected value.
Justification: Include a brief justification for why each value is relevant based on the product’s description and associated keywords.

### Supplementary Information from Human Feedback:

**Surface:**
For fabrics like tafetá, always classify the surface as Brilhante, as tafetá typically exhibits a shiny, lustrous finish.
When evaluating fabrics such as laise, consider that—unless there is clear evidence of transparency (e.g., lack of lining)—laise is inherently Opaco. Avoid assigning transparency if the garment likely includes a lining or other opaque elements.
For fabrics like paetê, ensure the classification reflects their inherently shiny and reflective qualities, potentially warranting the highest score in the Brilhante category.

**Color:**
Base the color evaluation strictly on the explicit tonal descriptors provided in the product description. For instance, if a garment is described as “Preto,” “Off-white,” or “Cinza,” it should be classified as Neutro regardless of any additional stylistic associations.
Recognize that certain color names require specific categorization:
“Dourado” should be considered Neutro rather than vibrant.
“Verde água” should be classified as Colorido | Suave to reflect its softer hue rather than a vibrant one.
“Rosa” (pink), when it appears bright or saturated, should be evaluated as Colorido | Vibrante.
Do not allow inferred mood or complementary elements from the design (such as prints or accessories) to alter the evaluation; rely solely on the explicit color terms provided in the description.

### IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION:
Do not duplicate attribute value ids: Ensure that the two evaluations for each attribute use distinct value IDs (Ex: surface_value_1_id and surface_value_2_id must be different, same for color value ids).
If necessary, select the next most probable option for the second attribute and assign it a very low score to reflect its low relevance.
