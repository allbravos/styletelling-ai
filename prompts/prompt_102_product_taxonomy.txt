You are an AI that helps identify the most relevant fashion attributes for a given product.
Analyze the product name and description provided and evaluate the Line and Structure attributes.
Focus on technical details over marketing language, prioritizing attributes explicitly stated or inferred from the product's name and core specifications.
For each attribute, identify the two most relevant values by ID from the predefined options, providing a relevance score (from 1 to 10, with 10 indicating perfect relevance) and a concise justification.
Return only the JSON output, without additional commentary.

Product Name: "{product_name}"
Product Description: "{product_description}"

### Attributes to Evaluate:

1. **Line**
Possible values with keywords:
1: Linhas Diagonais | Assimétricas (Keywords: assimétrico, decote de um ombro, decote transpassado, envelope, deslocado, pareô)
2: Linhas Orgânicas | Arredondadas (Keywords: bufante, balonê, decote redondo, decote careca, gola redonda, gola careca, peplum, manga balão, decote coração, decote em U, decote nadador)
3: Linhas Retas | Geométricas (Keywords: pantalona, blazer, camisa, decote quadrado, decote V, decote canoa, decote ombro a ombro, decote halter, alongado, chemise, cardigan)

1. **Structure**
Possible values with keywords:
1: Leve | Fluido (Keywords: esvoaçante, evasê)
2: Pesado | Estruturado (Keywords: encorpado, estruturado, pesado, ombreira, pala, peplum, puffer)

### Guidelines:
Relevance Score: Provide a score between 1 and 10 for each selected value.
Justification: Include a brief justification for why each value is relevant based on the product’s description and associated keywords.
Unique IDs: Ensure that the two evaluations for each attribute use distinct IDs and scores. Never duplicate the ID and its score for the two attribute evaluations. If necessary, select the next most probable option for the second attribute and assign it a very low score to reflect its low relevance.

### Supplementary Information from Human Feedback:

**Line:**

Do not assign the ‘Linhas Diagonais | Assimétricas’ classification solely based on the mention of diagonal cuts.
Only classify a garment under this attribute if its overall design, silhouette, or other design cues clearly support an asymmetric look. If the asymmetry is not evident or only minimally implied, adjust the score accordingly or select a more neutral categorization.

**Structure:**
Evaluate the structure based on the inherent characteristics of the fabric.
For fabrics such as tafetá or paetê, which are inherently rigid and structured, classify them as ‘Pesado | Estruturado’, regardless of other design elements like a flowy silhouette or decorative details.
Prioritize the material’s properties when determining structure, ensuring that structured fabrics are not misclassified as ‘Leve | Fluido.’

### IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION:
Do not duplicate attribute value ids: Ensure that the two evaluations for each attribute use distinct value IDs (Ex: surface_value_1_id and surface_value_2_id must be different, same for color value ids).
If necessary, select the next most probable option for the second attribute and assign it a very low score to reflect its low relevance.
