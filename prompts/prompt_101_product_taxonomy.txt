You are an AI that helps identify the most relevant fashion attributes for a given product.
Analyze the product name and description provided and evaluate the Material and Texture attributes.
Focus on technical details over marketing language, prioritizing attributes explicitly stated or inferred from the product's name and core specifications.
For each attribute, identify the two most relevant values by ID from the predefined options, providing a relevance score (from 1 to 10, with 10 indicating perfect relevance) and a concise justification.
Return only the JSON output, without additional commentary.

Product Name: "{product_name}"
Product Description: "{product_description}"

### Attributes to Evaluate:

1. **Material**
Possible values with keywords:
1: Jeans (Keywords: jeans)
2: Malha | Retilínea (Keywords: malha, canelada, tricô, jersey, ribana, plush, fleece, lycra, spandex, neoprene, moletom)
3: Tecido Festivo (Keywords: lurex, paetê, cetim, veludo, organza, tafetá, metalizado, renda, brocado, jacquard, lamê, musseline)
4: Tecido Plano (Keywords: crepe, viscose, seda, microfibra, tencel, liocel, viscolinho, nylon, sarja, lã, lã fria, gabardine, popeline, flanela, gaze)
5: Couro (Keywords: couro, couro sintético, PU, poliuretano, suede)

2. **Texture**
Possible values with keywords:
1: Liso (Keywords: crepe, viscose, seda, microfibra, tencel, liocel, viscolinho, nylon, sarja, lã, lã fria, gabardine, popeline, flanela, gaze)
2: Trabalhado (Keywords: bordado, texturizado, babado, franzido, renda, amarração, laise, strass, torcido, laço, metalizado, tricot, trançado, tweed, drapeado, jacquard, cotelê, ilhós, paetê)

### Guidelines:
Relevance Score: Provide a score between 1 and 10 for each selected value.
Justification: Include a brief justification for why each value is relevant based on the product’s description and associated keywords.
Unique IDs: Ensure that the two evaluations for each attribute use distinct IDs and scores. Never duplicate the ID and its score for the two attribute evaluations. If necessary, select the next most probable option for the second attribute and assign it a very low score to reflect its low relevance.

### Supplementary Information from Human Feedback:

**Material:**
When evaluating the material, base your decision solely on the inherent composition of the fabric. For example, linen (linho) should not be classified as Tecido Festivo simply because the garment is intended for an event; linen is more appropriately categorized as Tecido Plano (or another fitting category based on its inherent properties).
Similarly, with fabrics like laise, focus on the fabric’s intrinsic characteristics rather than the overall design of the garment. Even if a dress features laise, if its inherent qualities align with a plain fabric, it should be classified as Tecido Plano.

**Texture:**
Assess texture strictly according to the fabric’s inherent surface qualities (e.g., its weave, finish, and tactile attributes). Do not let design features or structural elements—such as ruffles (babados), lace details, or other decorative aspects—influence your evaluation.
Specifically, for laise, note that while it may be considered a plain material in the material evaluation, its actual weave often imparts a worked or textured quality. Therefore, laise should be evaluated as having a trabalhado texture rather than being deemed liso.

### IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION:
Do not duplicate attribute value ids: Ensure that the two evaluations for each attribute use distinct value IDs (Ex: surface_value_1_id and surface_value_2_id must be different, same for color value ids).
If necessary, select the next most probable option for the second attribute and assign it a very low score to reflect its low relevance.
