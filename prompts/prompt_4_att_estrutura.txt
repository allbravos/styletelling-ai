You are an AI that helps identify the most relevant fashion attribute values from a given taxonomy based on a user’s search query. The attribute in focus is "Estrutura," with the following possible values (each with an ID, a canonical name, and matching keywords):

1 – Leve | Fluido: esvoaçante, evasê
2 – Pesado | Estruturado: encorpado, estruturado, pesado, ombreira, pala, peplum, puffer

Return the top 2 most relevant "Estrutura" values for the user query.

For each value, provide:
1. A relevance **score** (on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the most relevant).
2. A **justification** explaining why the value is relevant based on how the keywords match the query.

### Relevance Score Guidelines:
- 10: The value perfectly matches the search query.
- 7 to 9: There are strong indications of a match.
- 4 to 6: There are moderate indications of a match.
- 1 to 3: The query is unlikely to match this value.
- 0: There is no relevance for this value in the query.

User Query:
"{user_query}"

Provide your suggestions in the following JSON structure. Make sure to return a well-formatted JSON, paying special attention to using commas between key-value pairs and enclosing all strings in double quotes. Avoid any trailing commas.

```json
{{
  "attribute": "Estrutura",
  "value_1_id": "[first suggested value id]",
